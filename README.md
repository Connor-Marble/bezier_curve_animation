Bezier Curve Animations

This is a small python program designed to make animations of bezier curves bei\
ng drawn using Tkinter. The purpose of these animations is to clearly show how \
these curves work.

Currently there are two modes, Draw and move. 

Draw will show the curve being progressivley drawn with guide lines and points to illustrate, while move shows how the curve behaves to the four end points moving around hte canvas
